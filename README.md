# AI2048


To put it simply it still does not work. Though one of the files that i have does actually run the version of 2048, coding the actual tile class in python seemed to be too big a bite to chew. Running the code for the game of 2048 is simple as you just enter the AI2048.py file and run the code. Unfortuanetly the AI isnt included due to the fact that fitness models and 2d arrays do not mix. This was the reason for the Tile class. If I had indiviudual tiles that had their own stored NN and genomes, I would be able to create a 2d array of them and then just average their outputs to make a decision. Problems was I cannot code in python to save my life. I understand it but everytime I write the code I get error codes.
